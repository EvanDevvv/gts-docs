Welcome to the **Advanced Spawner**!  

The most advanced spawner on the market for the bus community! This spawner consists of basic and advanced spawning, assigned buses, and category locking via Clothing, Group Rank, Roblox Premium, or Gamepass.

This version does come with an admin panel, which can be group-locked. The admin panel consists of server announcements, global announcements, despawning buses, and refueling buses. This version also comes with webhook logging so you can see when a user spawns a bus, despawns a bus, and when an admin runs any of the commands on the panel.

This version also has a separate tab for assigned buses, so users don't have to search for their assigned bus in that long list of buses! This version also comes with a cosmetics plugin, allowing users to spawn their buses with the cosmetics you add! The cosmetics plugin can also be gamepass locked, if you'd like that instead of it being free.

Compatible with **GenX**, **Huxley**, and even cars (if desired).

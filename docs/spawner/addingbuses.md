## Basic Spawner
### How to add buses

To add buses to the spawner, move the bus model into the 'Buses' folder within ServerStorage and name it the bus number as you wish.

Next, ```go to ReplicatedStorage -> BusConfigs -> Requested Category``` Duplicate the StringValue in the Buses folder and name it to the bus number like you did to the model.

[Please Move On to Configuration to Setup the Bus](configuration)

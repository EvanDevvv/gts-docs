## Customizing Your Bus

### Changing District Name

1. Under the "Specifications" tab, look for the "District Name" option.

2. Click on the text box and enter the desired text for the district name. The text will automatically update on the bus model. Please note that there is a character limit of 60 for the district name.

### Changing the Bus Number

1. Under the "Specifications" tab, locate the "Bus Number" option.

2. Enter the desired bus number in the text box. The bus number will be displayed on your bus model.

**Note**: The physical bus number will not change in studio editing mode. The "Bus Number" option changes the bus number value found in "DriveSeat." You will see the number change when you play test your game.

### Customizing Ambers, Reds & Taillights

1. Spawn your preferred amber/reds model in the studio.

**Important: YOU Have to make sure you rename your new and old light models to something new such as newAmber2 and oldAmber2, and you need to make sure that the models have a primarypart, otherwise it will not work.**

2. Under the "Specifications" tab, click on the arrow next to "Confirm Ambers Old Model." Select your old amber model. The UI will update to display the name of your old amber model.

3. Click on your new amber model and press "Confirm Ambers Model." The UI will update to display the name of your new amber model. Repeat the process for reds & taillights.

4. Please make sure you rename the parts or models back to the required name after replacing them, if you are unsure of the correct name, join our discord and ask someone.

**Some models may appear rotated incorrectly, all you have to do is rotate them 90 degress to get them back in the original spot.**

### Tinted Windows & Black Window Frames

1. Under the "Specifications" tab, find the checkboxes for "Tinted Windows" and "Black Window Frames."

2. Check the respective boxes based on your preferences. If you want both tinted windows and black window frames, check both boxes.

### Changing Rim Color & Material

1. Under the "Specifications" tab, locate the "Rim Color" option.

2. Go to https://g.co/kgs/nkHNq2 or search "Google color picker" in your browser.

3. Create your desired color and focus on the spot that says "RGB."

4. Copy the RGB numbers and paste them into the corresponding spots in the plugin.

5. Press "Confirm Rim Color" to apply the color to all rims.

**Note**: Alternatively, you can spawn a part in the studio, create your desired color, copy the RGB numbers, and paste them into the plugin.

6. Choose your preferred material (rusty or metal) by checking the corresponding box.

### Changing Rubrail Color

1. Under the "Specifications" tab, find the "Rubrail Color" option.

2. This option is only compatible with Huxley buses and will only work if you have all the rubrails in a model named "Rubrails."
**This will change soon.**

3. Use the Google color picker or spawn a part and use the RGB code to choose your rubrail color.

4. Copy the RGB code and paste it into the plugin.

5. Click "Confirm New Rubrail Color" to apply the color.

**Note**: For a yellow rubrail, alt + click on ANY yellow body part of the bus, copy the RGB color code from properties, and paste it into the plugin. Then click "Confirm New Rubrail Color."
